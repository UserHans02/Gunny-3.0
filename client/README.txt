1. Download and install Pale Moon 64-bit (a web browser that didn't drop support for Flash):

2. Download and install the most recent version of Flash for Windows that Adobe didn't kill 
(flashplayer32_0r0_371_win.msi):

Notes: 
The version of Pale Moon I used to test this was 29.2.0 (64-bit). 
You may want to disable updates for the Flash Player by going into Windows Control Panel, 
searching for "flash", clicking "Flash Player (32-bit), then "updates", 
and then changing it to "never check for updates." 
I don't believe this is required though since mine wasn't set to automatically install updates by default.
